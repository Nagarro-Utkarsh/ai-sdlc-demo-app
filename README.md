# Invoice Approval Demo App

A small invoice approval app used for live AI-in-SDLC demos. It is deliberately simple: a .NET 8 API, a plain web UI, and an in-memory store, so it runs with one command and no database.

## Run it

```
dotnet run --project backend/src/InvoiceApp.Api
```

Open http://localhost:5000 and sign in:

| User | Password | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `demo.manager` | `ChangeMe123!` | Manager |
| `demo.director` | `ChangeMe123!` | Director |
| `demo.admin` | `ChangeMe123!` | Admin |

These are demo accounts for a local, in-memory app. They are not real credentials.

## What it does

1. Create an invoice (it starts as a draft).
2. Submit it for approval.
3. A Manager or Director approves it within their limit, or rejects it with a reason.

Managers may singly approve invoices up to 50,000; Directors may singly approve up to 500,000. Invoices above 500,000 require a Manager's approval followed by a different Director's approval.
Invoices move through Draft, Pending Approval, then Approved or Rejected.

## Tests

```
dotnet test backend/InvoiceApp.sln
```
